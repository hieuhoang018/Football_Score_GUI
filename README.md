# Football_Score_GUI

This python program is my final project of the course Programming 1 - Introduction
to Programming.
  
This program allows the user to determine a leaderboard of 4 football
teams after 3 games each. At first, the user is asked to enter the team names.
Then the teams will be divided into matches and a new window will pop up,
allowing the user to enter their results. The user can then use a button and 
the program will display the final leaderboard after 3 games have ended.

The program will show error message when there are scores missing or the score
is negative.
